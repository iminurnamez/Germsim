Germsim
=======

Creates 4 blue "germs" which can move around, divide or die. During division, the new germ may be a mutant (a different color (R,Y, G) than its "parent"). Mutants never spawn a blue germ, only R,Y or G. During the simulation, you can toggle division, death and mutation. Also, holding down the mouse button will cause germs to come to the mouse cursor. Each individual color or "all" colors can react to the mouse. You can also print a quick population report to the terminal by pressing the space bar.
